**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Created Organizational Units (IT, HR, Sales)
2. Created Users and placed them in the appropriate OU.
3. Created Security Groups (IT_Staff, HR_Staff, Sales_Staff)
4. Added Users to their corresponding Groups.
5. Reset a user password and enforce "must change at next Login. "


**Result:**

- Users successfully logged in to the domain.
- Password reset forced the user to choose a new password at first login.
- Group membership reflected correctly in Active Directory.
