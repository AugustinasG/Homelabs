# Lab 02 â€“ DHCP + DNS

**Goal:**To set up a Windows VM server to give an IP address by DHCP to the Windows 10 VM Pro client.

**Environment:**
- Windows 10 Pro version in Oracle VirtualBox
- Windows Server 20222 in Oracle VirtualBox

**Repro Steps:**
1. Set up Windows Server 2022 VM.
2. Set static IP. (192.168.10.10 was chosen)
3. Installation of AD DS + DNS + DHCP
4. Setting up the DHCP scope and activating it
5. Setting the Internal network for both VMS
6. For this lab, disable IPv6 for DNS.
7. Set up Windows Pro 10 client VM.
8. Set Static IP (192.168.10.20) and set DNS to 192.168.10.10
9. Join the domain of Windows Server.
10. Set IP from static to auto.

**Troubleshooting:**
- ipconfig /all client side showed 169.254.x.x APIPA
- nslookup 192.168.10.10 Timed out.
- nslookup lab.local timeout
- ipconfig /all Windows server showed DNS::1

**Fix:**
- Setting client IP to static before joining domain.
- Disabling IPv6 for WINDOWS Server 2022
- Activating DHCP in the DHCP manager

**Result:** Client gets IP from DHCP and can ping, nslookup Windows Server.  
**What I learned:** Set a static IP before joining the domain.
